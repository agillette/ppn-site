The world letting you down lately? It's March, but it's still snowing like it's January. Russia is invading Ukraine about to start World War III. By the time you read this, True Detective will have ended. But, you know who is always there for you? Presentation Party Night. Let's do this.

Once again, we'll have a full line-up of fantastic peer presentations. Delicious beer is lovingly provided by our friends at The Brooklyn Brewery, as well as coconut water courtesy of the good people at ZICO Coconut Water!

Topics this month...

Bicycle Generator, Crossword Puzzles, Food Insecurity, This is Your Death, and Race (whoa).

Sharing is caring, so feel free to bring your own booze and any potluck-style snacks.

Doors open at 7p. The presentations start at 8p! Everyone's welcome! 21+ to drink.
