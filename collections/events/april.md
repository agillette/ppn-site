It's that time again. Spring has sprung, and we are back to soak your brain in the April showers of free beer and much smart talking. We're Presentation Party Night, and winter is for chumps.

Once again, we'll have a full line-up of fantastic peer presentations. Delicious beer is lovingly provided by our friends at The Brooklyn Brewery, as well as coconut water courtesy of the good people at ZICO Coconut Water!

Topics TBD

Doors open at 7p. The presentations start at 8p! Everyone's welcome! 21+ to drink.
